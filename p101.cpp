So, anyway, that's the plan, tomorrow morning at 6am we'll be starting module 4 lab, and i dont think it's going to be that hard, but you are going to be able to
learn an insane amount about registers interrupt handling and you'll have plenty of research to do to fully understand all of this, so i'm really excited to get into it
first thing in the morning*/
