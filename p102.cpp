/*
anyway, so the goal tomorrow is to work on this stuff from 6am to 10am, 
then we head into the city to buy ceramics and stuff,
 then we can get lunch at honest greens around 2 to do some more work, 
 which will be pretty clutch for getting back into a working routine, 
 then we will go to that bar we liked for those drinks we like, and then come backt o the campsite for
 dinner. gonna be dope.
