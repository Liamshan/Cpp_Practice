Alright, ya tomorrow morning we are going to work on module 4 lab in the mbed course
that is where i have been focusing my attention instead of in here altho would be good to be doing practice problems every night. and i 
will get back to doing this in the coming days, but I just really wanted to make the most of the mountain bike trails that we have around here becuase that 
opportunity for exercise and fun is going to be harder to find on seville
anyway, not much of an excuse, becuase you could be working early morning and late night.
